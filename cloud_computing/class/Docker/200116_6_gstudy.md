# Assignment: Compose For On-The-Fly Image Building and Multi-Container Testing
Goal: This time imagine you're just wanting to learn Drupal's admin and GUI, or maybe you're a software tester and you need to test a new theme for Drupal. When configured properly, this will let you build a custom image and start everything with docker-compose up including storing important db and config data in volumes so the site will remember your changes across Compose restarts.

+ Use the compose file you created in the last assignment (drupal and postgres) as a starting point.
+ Let's pin image version from Docker Hub this time. It's always a good idea to do that so a new major version doesn't surprise you.

## Compose File
+ We're going to build a custom image in this compose file for drupal service. Use Compose file from previous assignment for Drupal to start with, and we'll add to it, as well as change image name.
+ Rename image to custom-drupal as we want to make a new image based on the official drupal:8.6.
+ We want to build the default Dockerfile in this directory by adding build: . to the drupal service. When we add a build + image value to a compose service, it knows to use the image name to write to in our image cache, rather then pull from Docker Hub.
+ For the postgres:9.6 service, you need the same password as in previous assignment, but also add a volume for drupal-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data so the database will persist across Compose restarts.

## Start Containers, Configure Drupal

+ Start containers like before, configure Drupal web install like before.
+ After website comes up, click on Appearance in top bar, and notice a new theme called Bootstrap is there. That's the one we added with our custom Dockerfile.
+ Click Install and set as default. Then click Back to site (in top left) and the website interface should look different. You've successfully installed and activated a new theme in your own custom image without installing anything on your host other then Docker!
+ If you exit (ctrl-c) and then docker-compose down it will delete containers, but not the volumes, so on next docker-compose up everything will be as it was.
+ To totally clean up volumes, add -v to down command.
